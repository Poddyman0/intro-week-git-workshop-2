<p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Version Control Practice with Git</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>I set up a project to practice version control using Git on my local machine. This involved initializing a Git repository, monitoring file status, and managing changes through commits. The goal was to become proficient in tracking project changes and maintaining a clear history of modifications.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Git:</strong> For version control and tracking changes in the project.</li>
  <li><strong>Terminal/Command Line:</strong> For executing Git commands.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Features Implemented:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Repository Initialization:</strong> Initialized a new Git repository in my project folder by running <code>git init</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>File Status Monitoring:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Used <code>git status</code> to check the status of files, including identifying which files were modified, staged, or untracked.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Commit Management:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Made changes to files and used <code>git add</code> to stage these changes.</li>
      <li>Created commits with <code>git commit -m "Your commit message"</code> to record changes and maintain a history of the project.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Commit History Review:</strong> Used <code>git log</code> to review the commit history and understand the progression of the project.</li>
</ul>

<p>By completing these steps, I gained hands-on experience in essential version control practices, including setting up repositories, monitoring changes, and managing project history with commits.</p>
